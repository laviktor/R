#This file is to calculate Mean, Median, and Mode for R

#In order to create data sets, we use the "c()" function which stands for "combine".

#Mode is not built-in to R. We have to make our own function.
#Note: Source for mode syntax was found here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_mean_median_mode.htm

	uniqv <- unique(v)
	uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}

print("Suppose we have the following data set: 1, 2, 4, 2, 5.")

set1 <- c(1, 2, 4, 2, 5)
