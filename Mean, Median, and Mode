#This file is to calculate Mean, Median, and Mode for R

#In order to create data sets, we use the "c()" function which stands for "combine".

#Mode is not built-in to R. We have to make our own function.
#Note: Source for mode syntax was found here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_mean_median_mode.htm

getmode <- function(v)
{
	uniqv <- unique(v)
	uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}

print("Suppose we have the following data set: 1, 2, 4, 2, 5.")

set1 <- c(1, 2, 4, 2, 5)

mean1 <- mean(set1)
median1 <- median(set1)
mode1 <- getmode(set1)

#Concatenation is done differently in R. It uses the "cat()" function.
#Note: "print()" is a "slower" way of printing out stuff, as well as spacing new lines, and so on.
#It is better to use "cat()" if wanting to combine other variable types.
#Space after string values in "cat()" are not needed.

cat("\nThe mean is", mean1)
cat("\nThe median is", median1)
cat("\nThe mode is", mode1)
