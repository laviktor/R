#We want to be able to calculate the Z-score given the population mean and population standard deviation.
#In addition to that, we want to be able to acquire the associated percentages with the Z-Score.
#When teaaching, I describe this as the "forwards" direction. That is: x-values-->Z-score-->percentages. Eventually, we have to go the reverse direction.
