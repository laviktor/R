#We want to be able to calculate the Z-score given the population mean and population standard deviation.
#In addition to that, we want to be able to acquire the associated percentages with the Z-Score.
#When teaaching, I describe this as the "forwards" direction. That is: x-values-->Z-score-->percentages. Eventually, we have to go the reverse direction.

x <- 
mu <- 
sigma <- 

z <- (x - mu)/sigma

print(z)

cat("\n\nOnce we have the z-score, we can use it to calculate the percentage associated with the raw data using the probability normal distribution or 'pnorm()' function")

cat("\n\n", pnorm(x, mean = mu, sd = sigma))

#The format above is strictly finding left-tailed statistics (Must test again).
#To find the right tail, the probability value must be subtracted from one.
